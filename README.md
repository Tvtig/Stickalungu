# Stickalungu

Welcome to the open source repository of Stickalungu. 

This repo is intended to be used for educational purposes.

Stickalungu is a game I am writing in my spare time, mostly to learn the ins and outs of Unity and other tech stacks that are commonly used in game development. I make video tutorials about the various components which you can find here: www.youtube.com/Tvtig.
